### Introduction
Image Data Manager is the first java project I have worked on outside of school curriculum. It also marks my first attempt experimenting with user interface in java. Apart from the learning experience, I embarked on this project to conveniently manage image datasets for machine learning. Currently, this simple program is able to prepare your images to be fed to a training model through labelled subdirectories or by paths specified in a csv file. You can easily toggle between the two and hovering over the fields/buttons will provide you with tooltips on what to input. I do hope to introduce more functionalities to this program in the near future to come!

### Features
Currently able to convert images from being referenced in labelled subdirectories to paths in csv file and vice versa through the following selections:
```
1) CSV to Directories
2) Directories to CSV
```
Looking to add more features soon!
